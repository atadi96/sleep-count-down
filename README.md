# STOP POSTING AND GO TO SLEEP!
## Important!
The art (drawings) in this program were not made by me, I googled "kagaposting" and used a picture I liked.

## Usage
You can set a time in HH:MM:SS format, and select the suspend mode (either sleep or hibernate).
When you click the button, the countdown will start, and all the controls except the button will
become disabled. When it reaches zero, your PC will enter the selected suspend mode.
You can stop the countdown and enable the controls by pushing the button one more time.
